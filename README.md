### Description

Ello, im back with a new name for all those who know me, lost the passy to my other one (blah). Anyway, this prog simulates the cd drive autorun feature. I coded this prog for 2 reasons, 1. I hate autorun and have disabled it, BUT autorun holds the shortcut for cd loading (hence this prog), and 2. Coz no one (as far as im aware) has done this before. So, if your like me then disable autorun and use this prog to preform the exact same task only this time WHEN U WANT IT.

P.S. This prog also includes the sneaky little way i use secret areas in my progz, the 1 sec time delay on prog load to allow for a certain key to be pushed so the prog loads in a dif way (the secret area) GOTTA SEE THIS! (every line comented)

Laterz
